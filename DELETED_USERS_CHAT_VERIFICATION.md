# Deleted Users and Removed Members Chat Verification

This document explains the changes made to ensure that messages from deleted users and removed group members remain visible in the group chat.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The original implementation had two issues:

1. **Missing `deleted` field**: The queries didn't include the `deleted` field from the `profiles` table, so deleted users would show as "Unknown User"
2. **No handling for removed users**: Messages from users who were removed from the group would still be visible, but the sender information wasn't properly handled

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Updated Message Fetching API (`/api/groups/[groupId]/messages/route.ts`)

**Before:**

```sql
profiles(
  name,
  username,
  profile_photo
)
```

**After:**

```sql
profiles(
  name,
  username,
  profile_photo,
  deleted
)
```

**Message formatting logic updated:**

```typescript
const profile = message.users?.profiles;
const isDeleted = profile?.deleted === true;

return {
  // ... other fields
  sender: isDeleted ? "Deleted User" : profile?.name || "Unknown User",
  senderUsername: isDeleted ? undefined : profile?.username,
  avatar: isDeleted ? undefined : profile?.profile_photo,
  // ... other fields
};
```

### 2. Updated Real-time Message Handling (`useGroupChat.ts`)

**Before:**

```sql
profiles(
  name,
  username,
  profile_photo
)
```

**After:**

```sql
profiles(
  name,
  username,
  profile_photo,
  deleted
)
```

**Real-time message formatting updated:**

```typescript
sender: (() => {
  const profile = (messageData.users as any)?.profiles;
  const isDeleted = profile?.deleted === true;
  return isDeleted ? "Deleted User" : (profile?.name || "Unknown User");
})(),
senderUsername: (() => {
  const profile = (messageData.users as any)?.profiles;
  const isDeleted = profile?.deleted === true;
  return isDeleted ? undefined : profile?.username;
})(),
avatar: (() => {
  const profile = (messageData.users as any)?.profiles;
  const isDeleted = profile?.deleted === true;
  return isDeleted ? undefined : profile?.profile_photo;
})(),
```

### 3. Updated Group Members API (`/api/groups/[groupId]/members/route.ts`)

**Before:**

```sql
profiles(
  name,
  username,
  profile_photo
)
```

**After:**

```sql
profiles(
  name,
  username,
  profile_photo,
  deleted
)
```

**Member formatting logic updated:**

```typescript
const profile = member.users?.profiles;
const isDeleted = profile?.deleted === true;

return {
  // ... other fields
  name: isDeleted ? "Deleted User" : profile?.name || "Unknown User",
  username: isDeleted ? undefined : profile?.username,
  avatar: isDeleted ? undefined : profile?.profile_photo,
  // ... other fields
};
```

## üîç Verification Steps

### Step 1: Test with Existing Data

1. **Navigate to a group chat** that has messages from users who might have been deleted
2. **Check the chat interface** - messages from deleted users should show "Deleted User" as the sender
3. **Check the members list** - deleted users should appear as "Deleted User"

### Step 2: Run Automated Tests

1. **Load the test script** in your browser console:

   ```javascript
   // Copy and paste the contents of test-deleted-users-chat.js
   ```

2. **Run all tests**:

   ```javascript
   runAllTests();
   ```

3. **Or run individual tests**:
   ```javascript
   testDeletedUserMessages(); // Test message visibility
   testDeletedUserMembers(); // Test member list handling
   testRemovedUserMessages(); // Test removed user messages
   testRealtimeMessageHandling(); // Test real-time functionality
   ```

### Step 3: Manual Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Deleted User Messages

1. **Create a test group** with multiple users
2. **Have users send messages** in the group chat
3. **Delete a user's account** (set `deleted = true` in the `profiles` table)
4. **Verify** that their messages still appear with "Deleted User" as sender

#### Scenario 2: Removed User Messages

1. **Create a test group** with multiple users
2. **Have users send messages** in the group chat
3. **Remove a user from the group** (delete from `group_memberships`)
4. **Verify** that their messages still appear in the chat history

#### Scenario 3: Real-time Handling

1. **Open the group chat** in multiple browser tabs
2. **Send messages** from different users
3. **Delete a user account** while chat is active
4. **Verify** that new messages from the deleted user show "Deleted User"

## üìä Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Messages from Deleted Users

- **Sender name**: "Deleted User"
- **Username**: `undefined` (not displayed)
- **Avatar**: `undefined` (not displayed)
- **Message content**: Still visible and decryptable
- **Timestamp**: Preserved

### ‚úÖ Messages from Removed Users

- **Sender name**: Original name or "Unknown User"
- **Username**: Original username or `undefined`
- **Avatar**: Original avatar or `undefined`
- **Message content**: Still visible and decryptable
- **Timestamp**: Preserved

### ‚úÖ Real-time Updates

- **New messages** from deleted users show "Deleted User"
- **Existing messages** remain unchanged
- **Decryption** still works for encrypted messages
- **UI updates** properly reflect deleted user status

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Messages still show "Unknown User"

**Solution**: Check that the `deleted` field is properly set to `true` in the `profiles` table for the user.

### Issue: Real-time messages not updating

**Solution**: Verify that the Supabase real-time subscription is working and the `deleted` field is included in the query.

### Issue: Members list not showing "Deleted User"

**Solution**: Ensure the group members API is updated and the `deleted` field is included in the query.

### Issue: Test script not working

**Solution**:

1. Make sure you're logged into the application
2. Navigate to a group page or provide a valid group ID
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify that the API endpoints are accessible

## üîß Database Verification

To manually verify the database state:

```sql
-- Check for deleted users
SELECT
  u.id,
  p.name,
  p.username,
  p.deleted
FROM users u
JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE p.deleted = true;

-- Check messages from deleted users
SELECT
  gm.id,
  gm.user_id,
  p.name,
  p.deleted,
  gm.created_at
FROM group_messages gm
JOIN users u ON gm.user_id = u.id
JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE p.deleted = true;
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Messages from deleted users show "Deleted User" as sender
2. ‚úÖ Messages from removed users remain visible in chat history
3. ‚úÖ Real-time updates handle deleted users properly
4. ‚úÖ Group members list shows "Deleted User" for deleted members
5. ‚úÖ Encrypted messages from deleted users can still be decrypted
6. ‚úÖ No errors occur when accessing chat with deleted/removed users

## üéâ Summary

The changes ensure that:

- **Chat history is preserved** regardless of user account status
- **Deleted users are properly identified** with "Deleted User" label
- **Removed users' messages remain visible** in the chat
- **Real-time functionality works** with deleted users
- **UI gracefully handles** missing user information
- **Encryption/decryption continues to work** for all messages

This provides a robust chat experience that maintains message history while clearly indicating when users have been deleted from the system.
