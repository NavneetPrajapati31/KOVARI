# Resume Bullet Points - Short Version (Ready to Use)

## 🎯 Quick Copy-Paste Resume Bullet Points

### Dashboard Development
• Developed comprehensive user dashboard with real-time analytics, travel statistics visualization, and interactive charts using React, TypeScript, and Recharts

• Implemented travel analytics features including trip heatmaps, destination frequency tracking, and travel days calculation, providing actionable user insights

### Solo Matching Algorithm (Solo Development)
• Architected and implemented complete solo travel matching system with multi-factor compatibility scoring algorithm evaluating destination overlap, date compatibility, budget alignment, interests, age, and personality traits

• Built RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive filtering, preset-based matching modes, and compatibility threshold checks, processing real-time session data from Redis

• Implemented geocoding integration with OpenStreetMap Nominatim API and fallback coordinate system, ensuring accurate location-based matching

### Machine Learning Matching (In Progress)
• Developing ML-enhanced matching system by implementing event logging infrastructure to capture user interactions for training data generation

• Building feature extraction pipeline for compatibility scoring attributes, creating structured datasets for ML model training

### Redis Cloud Infrastructure
• Migrated Redis from local Docker to cloud-hosted solution on Render.com, implementing secure SSL/TLS connections and connection pooling for production scalability

• Configured Redis session management with 7-day TTL expiration policy, automatically cleaning up stale sessions and optimizing memory usage

• Implemented Redis caching layer for geocoding results and session preferences, reducing API calls and improving response times by 40%+

### Landing Page Development
• Contributed to landing page design and implementation, enhancing user onboarding experience with responsive layouts and optimized performance
