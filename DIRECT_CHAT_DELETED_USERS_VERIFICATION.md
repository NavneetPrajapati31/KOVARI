# Direct Chat Deleted Users Verification

This document explains the changes made to ensure that direct chats properly handle deleted users by showing "Anonymous" and maintaining chat accessibility.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The original direct chat implementation had several issues with deleted users:

1. **Blocked access**: The chat would show "This user no longer exists" and prevent access
2. **Missing sender information**: Messages didn't include sender profile information with the `deleted` field
3. **No "Anonymous" display**: Deleted users weren't properly identified in the UI

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Updated `useDirectChat` Hook (`src/shared/hooks/useDirectChat.ts`)

**Before:**

```typescript
// Only fetched basic message data
.select("*")
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Fetches messages with sender profile information including deleted field
.select(`
  *,
  sender:users!direct_messages_sender_id_fkey(
    id,
    profiles(
      name,
      username,
      profile_photo,
      deleted
    )
  )
`)
```

**Added sender profile information to message interface:**

```typescript
export interface DirectChatMessage {
  // ... existing fields
  sender_profile?: {
    name?: string;
    username?: string;
    profile_photo?: string;
    deleted?: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Updated real-time message handling:**

```typescript
// Fetch sender profile information for new messages
const { data: senderData } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select(
    `
    id,
    profiles(
      name,
      username,
      profile_photo,
      deleted
    )
  `
  )
  .eq("id", msg.sender_id)
  .single();

const messageWithProfile: DirectChatMessage = {
  ...msg,
  sender_profile: senderData?.profiles?.[0] || undefined,
};
```

### 2. Updated Direct Chat Page (`src/app/(app)/chat/[userId]/page.tsx`)

**Removed blocking for deleted users:**

```typescript
// Before: Blocked access completely
if (isPartnerDeleted) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-full items-center justify-center text-center p-8">
      <span className="text-md font-semibold text-destructive mb-2">
        This user no longer exists.
      </span>
      <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        You cannot send messages to a deleted user.
      </span>
    </div>
  );
}

// After: Allow access, show "Anonymous"
// Don't block access for deleted users - just show them as Anonymous
// The chat will still be accessible and messages will be visible
```

**Updated header display for deleted users:**

```typescript
// Show "Anonymous" for deleted users
<div className="font-semibold text-sm text-foreground">
  {isPartnerDeleted ? "Anonymous" : partnerProfile?.name || "Unknown User"}
</div>
<div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
  {isPartnerDeleted ? "" : `@${partnerProfile?.username || ""}`}
</div>
```

**Updated avatar display:**

```typescript
{isPartnerDeleted ? (
  <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 flex items-center justify-center font-semibold text-lg select-none">
    <User className="h-5 w-5" />
  </div>
) : partnerProfile?.profile_photo ? (
  <Avatar
    src={partnerProfile.profile_photo}
    alt={partnerProfile.name || partnerProfile.username || "User"}
    className="w-10 h-10"
  />
) : (
  // ... fallback avatar
)}
```

**Updated MessageList to handle deleted senders:**

```typescript
// Check if sender is deleted
const isSenderDeleted = msg.sender_profile?.deleted === true;

// Pass to MessageRow component
<MessageRow
  msg={msg}
  isSent={isSent}
  content={content}
  showSpinner={showSpinner}
  showError={showError}
  onRetry={onRetry}
  isSenderDeleted={isSenderDeleted}
/>
```

**Updated MessageRow component:**

```typescript
const MessageRow = React.memo(
  ({
    msg,
    isSent,
    content,
    showSpinner,
    showError,
    onRetry,
    isSenderDeleted,
  }: {
    msg: any;
    isSent: boolean;
    content: string;
    showSpinner: boolean;
    showError: boolean;
    onRetry?: (msg: any) => void;
    isSenderDeleted?: boolean;
  }) => (
    // ... component implementation
  )
);
```

**Removed disabled state for deleted users:**

```typescript
// Before: Disabled input for deleted users
disabled={iBlockedThem || theyBlockedMe || isPartnerDeleted}

// After: Allow sending messages to deleted users
disabled={iBlockedThem || theyBlockedMe}
```

### 3. Created Test Script (`test-direct-chat-deleted-users.js`)

**Comprehensive testing functions:**

- `testDirectChatWithDeletedUser()` - Tests chat loading with deleted users
- `testMessageDisplayForDeletedUsers()` - Tests message display
- `testHeaderDisplayForDeletedUsers()` - Tests header display
- `testChatAccessibilityForDeletedUsers()` - Tests chat accessibility
- `runAllDirectChatTests()` - Runs all tests

## üîç Verification Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup

1. **Set a user as deleted** in the database:

   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles
   SET deleted = true
   WHERE user_id = 'target-user-uuid';
   ```

2. **Verify the user is marked as deleted**:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, name, username, deleted
   FROM profiles
   WHERE user_id = 'target-user-uuid';
   ```

### Step 2: Manual Testing

1. **Navigate to a direct chat** with the deleted user
2. **Check the header** - should show "Anonymous" instead of the user's name
3. **Check the avatar** - should show a generic user icon
4. **Check messages** - should still be visible and decryptable
5. **Check message input** - should be enabled and allow sending messages
6. **Check chat actions** - should be accessible

### Step 3: Automated Testing

1. **Load the test script** in your browser console:

   ```javascript
   // Copy and paste the contents of test-direct-chat-deleted-users.js
   ```

2. **Run all tests**:

   ```javascript
   runAllDirectChatTests();
   ```

3. **Or run individual tests**:
   ```javascript
   testDirectChatWithDeletedUser();
   testMessageDisplayForDeletedUsers();
   testHeaderDisplayForDeletedUsers();
   testChatAccessibilityForDeletedUsers();
   ```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Chat Access

- **Accessibility**: Chat is fully accessible for deleted users
- **No blocking**: No error messages prevent access
- **Message input**: Enabled and functional
- **Chat actions**: Available and functional

### ‚úÖ Header Display

- **Name**: Shows "Anonymous" for deleted users
- **Username**: Hidden for deleted users
- **Avatar**: Generic user icon for deleted users
- **Profile link**: Still functional (leads to profile page)

### ‚úÖ Message Display

- **Sender information**: Available through `sender_profile` field
- **Deleted status**: Properly identified via `deleted` field
- **Message content**: Still visible and decryptable
- **Timestamps**: Preserved
- **Read status**: Still functional

### ‚úÖ Real-time Updates

- **New messages**: Include sender profile information
- **Profile updates**: Reflect changes in real-time
- **Deleted status**: Properly handled in real-time

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Messages still show "Unknown User"

**Solution**: Check that the `useDirectChat` hook is properly fetching sender profile information and the `deleted` field is included in the query.

### Issue: Header still shows original name

**Solution**: Verify that the `useUserProfile` hook is returning the correct `isDeleted` status and the header is properly checking this value.

### Issue: Chat is still blocked for deleted users

**Solution**: Ensure the blocking condition has been removed from the direct chat page and the `isPartnerDeleted` check is no longer preventing access.

### Issue: Real-time messages don't include sender information

**Solution**: Check that the real-time subscription is properly fetching sender profile information for new messages.

### Issue: Test script not working

**Solution**:

1. Make sure you're on a direct chat page
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Verify that the API endpoints are accessible
4. Ensure you have a deleted user to test with

## üîß Database Verification

To manually verify the database state:

```sql
-- Check for deleted users
SELECT
  u.id,
  p.name,
  p.username,
  p.deleted
FROM users u
JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE p.deleted = true;

-- Check direct messages from deleted users
SELECT
  dm.id,
  dm.sender_id,
  dm.receiver_id,
  p.name,
  p.deleted,
  dm.created_at
FROM direct_messages dm
JOIN users u ON dm.sender_id = u.id
JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE p.deleted = true;
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Direct chat is accessible for deleted users
2. ‚úÖ Header shows "Anonymous" for deleted users
3. ‚úÖ Messages from deleted users are still visible
4. ‚úÖ Message input is enabled for deleted users
5. ‚úÖ Chat actions are available for deleted users
6. ‚úÖ Real-time updates handle deleted users properly
7. ‚úÖ No blocking error messages appear
8. ‚úÖ Encrypted messages from deleted users can still be decrypted
9. ‚úÖ Profile information is properly fetched and displayed

## üéâ Summary

The changes ensure that:

- **Chat accessibility is maintained** regardless of user account status
- **Deleted users are properly identified** with "Anonymous" label
- **Message history is preserved** for deleted users
- **Real-time functionality works** with deleted users
- **UI gracefully handles** missing user information
- **Encryption/decryption continues to work** for all messages
- **No blocking behavior** prevents access to chats with deleted users

This provides a robust direct chat experience that maintains message history while clearly indicating when users have been deleted from the system, without blocking access to the conversation.
